# Deployment Options Summary

This project supports **two deployment methods** to suit different use cases and environments.

---

## 📦 Option A: Local Deployment

**Best for:** Development, testing, quick iterations

### Pros
✅ Fast iteration cycle
✅ Full control over deployment process
✅ Easy debugging
✅ No GitHub setup required

### Cons
❌ Requires local AWS credentials
❌ Manual execution
❌ No audit trail

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Deploy
cdk deploy --require-approval never

# 3. Load data
python3 load_sample_data.py

# 4. Verify
./verify_deployment.sh
```

### When to Use
- ⚡ Rapid prototyping and testing
- 🔧 Debugging infrastructure issues
- 👨‍💻 Personal development environments
- 📚 Learning and experimentation

---

## 🚀 Option B: CI/CD via GitHub Actions

**Best for:** Production, team collaboration, automated deployments

### Pros
✅ Automated deployment on workflow trigger
✅ OIDC authentication (no long-lived credentials)
✅ Audit trail in GitHub Actions logs
✅ Environment separation (dev/staging/prod)
✅ Consistent deployments across team
✅ Deployment summaries and notifications

### Cons
❌ Initial OIDC setup required
❌ GitHub repository needed
❌ Slower feedback loop

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Setup OIDC (one-time)
# See CICD_SETUP.md for detailed instructions

# 2. Add GitHub secret
# AWS_ACCOUNT = your AWS account ID

# 3. Trigger workflow
# Actions → Deploy Mobiltex Data Lake → Run workflow
```

### When to Use
- 🏢 Production deployments
- 👥 Team collaboration
- 🔒 Enhanced security (OIDC)
- 📊 Compliance and audit requirements
- 🔄 Consistent, repeatable deployments

---

## 🔄 Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

Use **both methods** for maximum flexibility:

| Environment | Method | Why |
|------------|--------|-----|
| **Development** | Local | Fast iteration, easy debugging |
| **Staging** | CI/CD | Test automation pipeline |
| **Production** | CI/CD | Security, audit trail, consistency |

---

## 📊 Feature Comparison

| Feature | Local | CI/CD |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Setup Time** | 5 min | 30 min (one-time) |
| **Deployment Time** | ~2 min | ~5 min |
| **Authentication** | AWS CLI credentials | OIDC (temporary tokens) |
| **Audit Trail** | CloudTrail only | CloudTrail + GitHub logs |
| **Rollback** | Manual `cdk destroy` | One-click workflow trigger |
| **Multi-environment** | Manual config | Built-in support |
| **Team Access** | Individual AWS keys | Centralized via GitHub |
| **Security** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
